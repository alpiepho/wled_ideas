This is a repo with ideas etc related to the WLED project:

This is project I ran across lately with an Adafruit project that shows installing WLED on a QTPi: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-remote-ir-control-with-wled/overview

I was able to get this working with a little effort.  The two biggest hurdles were the wire colors not matching the small photos.  And the description of what WLED settings to use were in text.  It would have helped to see screen shots.

I was also hesitent because I wanted to understand the bigger concepts of WLED before I blindly started installing software.
